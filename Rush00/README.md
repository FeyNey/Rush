# My 42 Rush00 boosted

This project is a program that make you build a rectangle with whatever caracters you like

## Rules

You must write a function called rush with the following specifications:
◦ It must take two integer arguments, named x and y.
◦ The function must be placed in the rush0X.c file

• Your rush function must display a rectangle on the screen with a width of x characters and a height of y characters.
• Your function must never crash or enter an infinite loop

### Initialisation

For the mandatory part type 'make' in your terminal, if you execute rush it will sort you the default Rush00 from 42 school
You can modify x and y in the main.

For the bonus you can 'make bonus' in your terminal and it will give you the executable rush_bonus.
You can enter directly the name of the Rush you wan't between 00 and 04 witch are
the default rushes symbol you need to do in the 42 school

Example : ./rush_bonus Rush03

And then give the lense in x and y for the width and the length of the rectangle

Example : ./rush_bonus Rush02 5 4

If you wan't to custom your rectangle, you can call ./rush_bonus Rush0X x y
